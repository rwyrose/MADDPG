# SwitchTree
In-Network detection of attacks using Random Forests

Please cite this paper if you use this code:

`Jong-Hyouk Lee and Kamal Singh, "SwitchTree: In-network Computing and Traffic Analyses with Random Forests", Neural Computing and Applications (2020)`
 
We perform in-network analysis of the network data by exploiting the power of programmable data planes. 
SwitchTree coded in P4 embeds Random Forest algorithm inside a programmable switch such that the 
Random Forest is configurable and re-configurable at runtime. We show how some flow level 
stateful features can be estimated, such as the round trip time and bitrate of each flow.

# Quick Start Guide
To run the code
1. Use or Create a BMV2 VM or machine. For example you may download the VM from here provided by P4 developer day: https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lYF4NgFkYoRqtskdGTMxy3sXUV0jkMxo&export=download

2. Check if the examples are compiling and working in tutorials/exercises folder. 

3. Copy the SwitchTree folder to tutorials/exercises/ folder

4. cd to SwitchTree folder 

4. `make`

5. Open a new terminal and cd to tutorials/exercises/switchtree folder. Add rules (trained Decision Trees were translated to SwitchTree P4 rules using a script) to P4 switch by 

`simple_switch_CLI < commands_1_tree.txt`

6. Send the traffic using tcpreplay. A demo test file containing 1000 packets is provided in demo_data. It is extracted from UNSW database.

`sudo tcpreplay -i s1-eth1 demo_data/UNSW_1000_packets.pcap`

7. To obtain results, you make check the counter values. The number of malware flows injected (tracked using other means for statistics) is provided by counter_malware_flows and 
the actually detected ones are provided by counter_true_detection_flows. 

`simple_switch_CLI < get_results.txt`



To use SwitchTree with 3 trees: 

`cp  switchtree.3trees switchtree.p4`

`make clean`

`make`

`simple_switch_CLI < commands_3_trees.txt`

Note you may need to exit and type make again to reinitialize and do a new test with new data. 

8. In case you want to do performance evaluations and heavy tests: debugging and logging should be disabled otherwise several packets will be lost during real-time tests. This can be done by downloading the source of behavioral-model (https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) to your home directory and recompiling it using the options that disable logging

(TODO: I have put the commands below that I remember. Need to test and verify them.)

`cd behavioral-model/`

`sudo ./configure 'CXXFLAGS=-g -O3' 'CFLAGS=-g -O3' --disable-logging-macros --disable-elogger`

`sudo make`

`sudo make install`

9. If you want to train your own decison trees and random forests then please see the scripts folder.
